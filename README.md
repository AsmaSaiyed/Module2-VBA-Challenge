***### Module2-VBA-Challenge***

***#This repository contains the VBS scripts and Screen shots for the source file of stocks in multiple year.***

The main aim of this assingment is to create a VBA script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

1.The ticker symbol

2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
   
3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year and The total stock volume of the stock.

4. Additionally the data has been arranged to add functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

5. The  Script has been written to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
