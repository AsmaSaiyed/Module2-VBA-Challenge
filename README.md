***# Module2-VBA-Challenge***

This repository contains the VBS codes and Screen shots for the sample file of stocks in multiple year
The main aim of this assingment is to create a VBA script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol, Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year, the percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year and The total stock volume of the stock.
- Add functionality to the script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
-  Make the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
